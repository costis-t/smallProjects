= Read cells from spreadsheets
:source-highlighter: Rouge
:toc:

== Motivation
I want to read specific cells from large Excel files of over 50 MB.
Opening, checking the specific cells, and closing each spreadsheet (or 10 of spreadsheets) is time consuming.
I measured that for 108 spreadsheets I needed to consume ~45 minutes of my time.
This script prints the relevant cells in the command line, while I can do more useful tasks. :bulb:

[source, shell]
----
$ python main.py <filename_pattern> <start_cell> <end_cell>
----

== Example Output
Help:
[source,shell]
----
$ python main.py --h

positional arguments:
