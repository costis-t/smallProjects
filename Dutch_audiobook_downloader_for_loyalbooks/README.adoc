= LoyalBooks Audiobook Downloader
:source-highlighter: Rouge
:toc:

== Motivation
It's nice to listen to Audiobooks in Dutch when I travel!
The zipped public domain MP3s from http://www.loyalbooks.com[LoyalBooks] are great, but are hundreds of MB each and downloading each one is tedious.

== Description
It creates a bash script `wget_commands.bash` to download the audiobooks using https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/[wget].
The filenames include the book author, title and original `.zip` filename with this pattern: `<book author>\_-_<book title>_::_<original filename from loyalbooks>.zip`.
The destination folder is `./downloaded_audiobooks/`.
It has only been tested for Dutch, but other languages should work, too.
This repo has the bash script for the Dutch language ready.

== Usage
[source, shell]
----
$ python main.py <language> <pages>

== Example Output
Help:
[source,shell]
