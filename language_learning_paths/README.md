# Introduction

Learning a language reading books is the best thing that has happened to me in learning my fifth "foreign" language, 
because it combines a form of art (literature) with learning.

In the era of ebook readers, amazing reading applications like koreader and information barrage,
I often found challenging the choice of the next book I should read in my language learning journey.

This is why I created this small script.
It uses a database of ebooks and helps me select my next book based on various criteria, mainly focused on the
number of unique words and two readability indices.
The method is by no means definitive, but it has helped me great so far.
It's not definitve because analyzing texts from so many diverse sources scientifically correctly has its challenges, 
but also, for language learning is out of scopus --- learning an extra word by mistake is not a problem! :)
